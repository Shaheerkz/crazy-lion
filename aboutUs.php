                            Our Hemp Story
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            began 13 years ago in early September of 2009. It was the end of the summer, and our oldest daughter, Courtney, had been critically injured in an auto accident at 18 years old.

                        <h3>Read about the integrity, passion and family values that led us to the production of high-quality hemp products.</h3>
                        <p>The accident left her hospitalized for 11 days, with injuries that included a broken back, severe lacerations, and the need for a splenectomy, ribectomy, and colectomy. These wounds required additional, specialized at-home care for months afterward, and the back pain and chronic health issues would, unfortunately, plague her for years to come. Finally, after almost a decade of suffering from the side effects of her injuries, she needed reconstructive surgery to alleviate one particularly challenging daily issue. During the spring of 2018, she underwent surgery at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, NC, with the expectation that she would resume a normal, healthy life afterward.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>The surgery, thankfully, helped alleviate many of our daughter’s daily physical issues, and the surgeons were right – her body began to heal, and her old injuries became less noticeable. However, the years of physical suffering took a huge toll on her mentally and emotionally as well. She had been incredibly strong throughout the entire recovery journey but very understandably began suffering from a wide range of debilitating mental and emotional issues after surgery. This affected everything from her ability to heal to getting quality sleep to just functioning in everyday life. As any parent can relate, it was extremely difficult watching our child struggle and not being able to help. We wanted nothing more than to take our daughter’s pain away and see her mentally and physically well again.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Then one day, while Courtney was home recovering from surgery, a friend of hers from work brought her some CBD to try. The friend explained it was useful for alleviating physical discomforts of many kinds as well as symptoms associated with mood disorders. Knowing very little news about CBD, she trusted her friend’s advice, taking one dose and, to her surprise, noticed relief within the hour. Several days later, Courtney shared her experience with us and brought us the oil to try for ourselves. We were all skeptical but tried it anyway. We could not believe what we were experiencing, and all immediately noticed a difference in the way we were feeling.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>This small plant, which was man’s first agricultural product over 10,000 years ago, somehow had made its way into modern-day holistic medicine and then into my home. After experiencing the effects ourselves as a family, we became believers. So the next question was, “How can we spread the word and help people like our daughter at the same time?”</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>After months of family discussions, we all agreed that telling our story was exactly how we could help. Everyone knew what had happened with our daughter’s accident and surgery, etc., but did they really know everything? Specifically, did they know how CBD helped Courtney recover from the aftermath of her accident and surgeries?.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>That’s when we knew we needed a safe place to bring people together – a physical location and online community where people could openly discuss their issues, ask questions, and ultimately get relief. The Hemp Doctor was created for all of the “Courtneys” out there and their families. It’s for people just like us who want answers about CBD and all of its many benefits. We are proud to share our daughter’s amazing story, how CBD played a significant role in her recovery, and the fact that we are a family-owned hemp business providing superior customer service and premium CBD products in North Carolina and across the country..</p>
